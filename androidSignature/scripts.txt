The keystone is for release key. For debug, we should share the same debug keystore, which is in my case is /Users/wayliu/.android/debug.keystore

We can now find our unsigned APK file in platforms/android/bin. Let's generate our private key using the keytool command that comes with the JDK

keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Now your .keystore file is created in the current directory, sign the unsigned APK with the key. Run the jarsigner tool which is also included in the JDK

jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore ../platforms/android/ant-build/HouseDiary-debug-unaligned.apk alias_name

jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore ../platforms/android/ant-build/HouseDiary-release-unsigned.apk alias_name

adb install -r ../platforms/android/ant-build/HouseDiary-release-unsigned.apk 

We have a signed apk, and finally need to run the zip align tool to optimize the APK:

zipalign -v 4 HouseDiary-release-unsigned.apk HouseDiary.apk
